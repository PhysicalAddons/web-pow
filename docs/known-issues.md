**Latest POW 2.x not usable (all pink) on MacOS**

In order for the POW addon to function correctly, Blender needs to utilize attribute nodes, which are not supported in the latest Blender updates on MacOS, causing the addon to malfunction. Here's [more in depth explanation](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/112952) for the issue.

> We'll be taking closer look at the attribute nodes and how to address this issue right after the release.


**PSA presets (from Asset Browser) overwrite POW ocean data**

When using Physical Starlight atmosphere (PSA) together with Physical Open water addon and applying asset it will overwrite World data and break the water surface.

> We'll be migrating PSA assets to our preset system to avoid this issue.


<!-- **When disabling `Underwater > World Underwater` sometimes breaks World shader**

For example if Physical Starlight Atmosphere -->
